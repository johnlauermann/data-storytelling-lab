This repository hosts teaching materials produced by the Data Storytelling Lab at Pratt Institute. There is widespread interest in data storytelling around Pratt Institute, as evidenced by faculty research initiatives and student demand for data storytelling coursework. Yet there are significant barriers to entry for this practice, including technical skills for working with data; knowledge of data content, formatting, and standards; and creative skills related to visualization, narrative, and UX design. We established the Data Storytelling Lab (DSL) as a teaching lab focused on identifying, implementing, and assessing best practices for teaching and learning about data storytelling. Here you can find workshops and tutorials procuded by lab contributors, focused on technical skills for data communication. Faculty and students are welcome to use these materials as teaching and learning resources.
